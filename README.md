# PipeLeaf
## Overview 
Craft two customizable smoking pipe models.  Collect herbs from the Wildcraft mod and use the pipe to apply buffs!

Buffs:

   - Focus: adds a small amount to you temporal stability to help you stay underground that much longer.
   - Warmth: helps you on those cold nights to prevent frost damage and the shivers.
   - Appetite Suppression: Burn less calories over a thirty (irl) minute period, buff reduces overtime.

 

Debuffs:

   - Heavy Hitter: hold in your toke for too long and you will take some damage.
   - Long Term Smoker: use too much too often and you may eventually experience a max health reduction. Stop using for a few hours or days and the debuff will be removed.

## Recipes
The mod introduces two unique craftable and material customizable pipe recipes.
### Brair Smoking Pipe
The Briar Smoking Pipe requires a rare drop item called a Briar Burl which you can only get by digging up a new plant call Tree Briar.  Keep your eye out for this white-petaled heather.  Then you must soak the raw Burl in a barrel with water and let it dry before it can be crafted into a smoking pip bowl.

The stem of the pipe is crafted separately in a smithing recipe and can use any metal type you like. Put the bowl and the stem together to craft your Briar Smoking Pipe.

### Clay Smoking Pipe
The Clay Smoking Pipe is also crafted in two parts and each piece can be made out of different types of clay.  Fire the raw pieces and put them together to form the Clay Smoking Pipe.

## TODOS:
- Narrow down smokable plants
- Allow plants to be configured to have different effects
